** tulip Official Release XQ v11.5 Changelog **

(26/07/2020)
- FBE Build 
- Upstreamed SDM660 kernel to 4.4.231
- Initial import of XiaomiParts with few features (KCAL, Dirac, Headset settings and Vibrator strenght)
- Add Spectrum support
- Nuke Dirac from XiaomiParts because it's already on Settings/Sounds

XiaomiParts notes:
- Vibrator strenght on Xiaomi doesn't work with stock kernel. If you want to use that, you could switch to a custom kernel.
- When you set KCAL on boot, it won't work. Your settings will be the same as you left, but you should change at least of 1 value to see the changes. Example:If your settings was R=220 G=220 B=220, you'll need to change only 1 value, like red to 219 and bring back to 220, and you'll see the changes.
