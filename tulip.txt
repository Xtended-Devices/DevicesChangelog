Note: Due to the switch to EAS trees and drivers update, clean flash is highly recommended if you want to have the maximum performance. With dirty flash, you won't get drivers update according to tester's report.
Also is suggested to use official TWRP, as encryption in broken with OrangeFox. You can use OF if you'll decide to decrypt, but I suggest official TWRP. Enjoy :D
